### Thread Extension (If you want to add more tweets below the main one)

**Tweet 2 (The Challenge):**
The hardest part? LLMs are too slow to count reps from 30fps video live. So we built a hybrid: deterministic physics logic inside the YOLO processor to force count reps, and let Gemini handle the human connection and coaching. Best of both worlds! 🧠⚙️
