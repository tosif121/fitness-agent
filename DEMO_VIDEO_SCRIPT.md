Working out at home sounds great. Until you realize... nobody is watching your form.
You could be destroying your knees with bad squats, and you'd never know.
What if your webcam could actually coach you? In real time?

Meet FitAgent. A real-time AI personal trainer that lives entirely in your browser.
No app downloads. No wearable sensors. No expensive gym memberships.
Just open your webcam, and your AI coach is ready.

Under the hood, FitAgent uses three powerful technologies working together.
First, YOLO eleven pose detection tracks seventeen key points on your body at thirty frames per second.
Second, a deterministic physics engine analyzes your joint angles to count every single rep, instantly.
And third, Google Gemini Realtime acts as your voice coach. It sees your movement, hears your voice, and talks back to you. Live.

FitAgent can auto-detect any exercise you start performing. Whether it's push-ups, jumping jacks, or lunges, it adapts instantly. 
Let me show you how it works with a simple example: Squats.
Watch what happens when I start my first set.

The AI instantly recognizes the movement, creates a tracker, and starts counting my reps. No buttons pressed. No manual data entry.
It's analyzing the angle of my hips relative to my knees in real time to ensure I hit proper depth.

And here's where it gets really cool.
The AI coach isn't just counting. It's watching my form and speaking to me in real time.
It corrects my posture, motivates me, and assigns a live form score. All through natural voice conversation. It's like having a trainer right in the room.

But remember, this isn’t just for squats. Drop to the floor, and it instantly tracks your push-ups. Stand up and do jumping jacks, it tracks those too, logging your entire dynamic session on the live dashboard.

When I'm done, I hit "End Session," and FitAgent gives me a full workout summary.
Total duration, a complete breakdown of every exercise completed, sets, and an overall form score based on my performance.
It's an instant review of my entire session, beautifully summarized.

FitAgent was built for the Vision Possible hackathon using the Stream Vision Agents SDK, Google Gemini, and YOLO eleven.
It proves that real-time computer vision isn't just about seeing pixels. It's about understanding human movement, providing instant coaching, and making fitness accessible to everyone.
This is FitAgent. Your AI coach is ready. Are you?
