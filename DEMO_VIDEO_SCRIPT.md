## SCRIPT

### [0:00 – 0:12] HOOK — The Problem

> Working out at home sounds great. Until you realize... nobody is watching your form.
> You could be destroying your knees with bad squats, and you'd never know.
> What if your webcam could actually coach you? In real time?

_[Screen: Quick montage — person exercising alone at home, confused expression]_

### [0:12 – 0:25] INTRO — Meet FitAgent

> Meet FitAgent. A real-time AI personal trainer that lives entirely in your browser.
> No app downloads. No wearable sensors. No expensive gym memberships.
> Just open your webcam, and your AI coach is ready.

### [0:25 – 0:45] THE MAGIC — How It Works

> Under the hood, FitAgent uses three powerful technologies working together.
> First, YOLO eleven pose detection tracks seventeen key points on your body at thirty frames per second.
> Second, a deterministic physics engine analyzes your joint angles to count every single rep, instantly.
> And third, Google Gemini Realtime acts as your voice coach. It sees your movement, hears your voice, and talks back to you. Live.

### [0:45 – 1:15] LIVE DEMO — Squat Tracking

> Let me show you how it works with a simple exercise: Squats.
> Watch what happens when I start my first set.

_[Screen: User stands in front of camera. Starts doing squats. The HUD lights up — "AI found you doing Squats!" — rep counter starts ticking: 1, 2, 3...]_

> The AI instantly recognizes the movement, creates a tracker, and starts counting my reps. No buttons pressed. No manual data entry.
> It's analyzing the angle of my hips relative to my knees in real time to ensure I hit proper depth.

### [1:15 – 1:35] LIVE DEMO — Voice Coaching

> And here's where it gets really cool.
> The AI coach isn't just counting. It's watching my form and speaking to me in real time.

_[Screen: User does a few more squats. Gemini voice says something like "Great depth! Keep your chest up." The feedback toast appears on the HUD]_

> It corrects my posture, motivates me, and assigns a live form score. All through natural voice conversation. It's like having a trainer right in the room.

---

### [1:35 – 1:50] SESSION SUMMARY

> When I'm done, I hit "End Session," and FitAgent gives me a full workout summary.
> Total duration, total squats completed, sets, and an overall form score based on my performance.

_[Screen: Summary modal appears with the neon-styled stats breakdown]_

> It's an instant review of my entire session, beautifully summarized.

---

### [1:50 – 2:10] CLOSING — The Vision

> FitAgent was built for the Vision Possible hackathon using the Stream Vision Agents SDK, Google Gemini, and YOLO eleven.
> It proves that real-time computer vision isn't just about seeing pixels. It's about understanding human movement, providing instant coaching, and making fitness accessible to everyone.
> This is FitAgent. Your AI coach is ready. Are you?
